It's getting crazy, it's hard to hold on
You gotta keep the pace
If you get too late, you're outrun
Our destiny is frail, living the dream
Tripping the virtual life, gonna jump the ride to be seen

An in-transparent challenge
Delicate balance, trying to keep in the line

You're gotta roll with the punches
Gonna stick to your guns
Or you're gonna get hurt in a runaway world
Stay by the track or the train will pass you by

It's pre-decided, time won't await
We are just visitors here
While the reaper sharpens his blade
Our lives are changing lanes, the future looks pale
Some of us bound to win
While your best friend's lost down the trail

Gonna stay on the course or you'll stumble and fall in between
You're gonna roll with the punches
Gonna stick to your guns
Or you're gonna get hurt in a runaway world
Stay by the track or the train will pass you by
Between a rock and a hard place
You're caught in a rat race
It's a bless and a curse in a runaway world
You gotta fight to be heard and fight to be recognized

In this ever-changing world
Stuck in a moment and you can't flee
Gotta move or die and dare to be

Follow the stream, ride with your dreams
It's a runaway
