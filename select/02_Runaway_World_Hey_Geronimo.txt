One thing you can't escape, welcome to a runaway world
One thing you can't escape, welcome to a runaway world
One thing you can't escape, welcome to a runaway world

I can't keep up with the pace that we're going
It's like I'm riding the fin of a shark
I keep on losing touch, I can't connect enough
It keeps on running around in my head
What she meant when she said

Do you really wanna waste away
Holding out for the perfect day?
I don't really wanna miss this train
Hey, one thing you can't escape, welcome to a runaway world
Runaway world

I ask and she says it's easy peasy
Just watch how I keep on turning the wheel
I suck a cigarette in the scarce human air
It keeps on running around in my head
What she meant when she said

Do you really wanna waste away
Holding out for the perfect day?
I don't really wanna miss this train
Hey, one thing you can't escape, welcome to a runaway world

Taste the rain, catch the thunder
Change my name, lose my number
Feel the rays on my face

Hey, one thing you can't escape, welcome to a runaway world
One thing you can't escape, welcome to a runaway world
One thing you can't escape, welcome to a runaway world

Do you really wanna waste away
Holding out for the perfect day?
I don't really wanna miss this train
Hey, one thing you can't escape, welcome to a runaway world
Hey, one thing you can't escape, welcome to a runaway world
Hey, one thing you can't escape, welcome to a runaway world
Runaway
