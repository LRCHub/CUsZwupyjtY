I've heard all the talk
yeah this road's no good for you
a line of bleeding hearts behind her throne
and she flaunts them like she's claimed them as her own
she's built her castle through the sky
but there's a part of me she won't defy
I've built my guard up just as high
and she's breaking through this
the wall's on fire
here's my heart for you
have you been rendered breathless
will you fall off
or will you follow and invade my runaway world
I must be honest
it hasn't been this way in years
and I never thought I'd let this come
they're telling me your love is faithless
but this is the way out
I'm finally feeling somewhat free and I'm afraid
free and I'm afraid
that she's... chorus
we can catch this by the tail in time
as the ship sets sail we're all in flight
and we'll barrel past these stars tonight
and they're slowing down they're slowing down
I can barely see the flames
as we're slowing down
can you ask this world to wait around
just one more round
yeah she's... chorus
my runawaaaay yeah eah whoa ohhh
my runawaaaay my runaway
let this carry on just get me through these nights and days of this world
oh will you follow and invade my runaway world
would you watch me fade away or be my getaway in this runaway world
